[Forms](forms.mdx) no longer reject their execution before a potential custom 
action for validating / extracting slots was executed. 
Forms continue to reject in two cases automatically:
- A slot was requested to be filled, but no slot mapping applied to the latest user
  message and there was no custom action for potentially extracting other slots.
- A slot was requested to be filled, but the custom action for validating / extracting
  slots didn't return any slot event.
  
Additionally you can also reject the form execution manually by returning a 
`ActionExecutionRejected` event within your custom action for validating / extracting 
slots.
