Fixed a bug with `rasa data split nlu` which caused the resulting train / test ratio to sometimes differ from the ratio specified by the user or by default. 

The splitting algorithm ensures that every intent and response class appears in both the training and the test set. This means that each split must contain at least as many examples as there are classes, which for small datasets can contradict the requested training fraction. When this happens, the command issues a warning to the user that the requested training fraction can't be satisfied.
