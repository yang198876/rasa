Fixed a bug that occurred when setting multiple Sanic workers in combination with a custom [Lock Store](lock-stores.mdx). Previously, if the number was set higher than 1 and you were using a custom lock store, it would reject because of a strict check to use a [Redis Lock Store](lock-stores.mdx#redislockstore).
