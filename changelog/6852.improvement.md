Adds the option to configure whether extracted entities should be split by comma (`","`) or not. The default behaviour is `True` - i.e. split any list of extracted entities by comma. This makes sense for a list of ingredients in a recipie, for example `"avocado, tofu, cauliflower"`, however doesn't make sense for an address such as `"Sch√∂nhauser Allee 175, 10119 Berlin, Germany"`.

In the latter case, add a new option to your config, e.g. if you are using the `DIETClassifier` this becomes:

```yaml
...
- name: DIETClassifier
  split_entities_by_comma: False
...
```

in which case, none of the extracted entities will be split by comma. To switch it on/off for specific entity types you can use:

```yaml
...
- name: DIETClassifier
  split_entities_by_comma: 
    address: True
    ingredient: False
...
```

where both `address` and `ingredient` are two entity types. 

This feature is also available for `CRFEntityExtractor`.
