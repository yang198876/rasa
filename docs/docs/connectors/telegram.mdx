You first have to create a Telegram bot to get credentials.
Once you have them you can add these to your `credentials.yml`.

## Getting Credentials

**How to get the Telegram credentials:**
You need to set up a Telegram bot.

1. To create the bot, go to [Bot Father](https://web.telegram.org/#/im?p=@BotFather),
   enter `/newbot` and follow the instructions. The URL that Telegram should send messages to will look like
   `http://<host>:<port>/webhooks/telegram/webhook`, replacing
   the host and port with the appropriate values from your running Rasa X or Rasa Open Source server.

2. At the end you should get your `access_token` and the username you
   set will be your `verify`.

3. If you want to use your bot in a group setting, it's advisable to
   turn on group privacy mode by entering `/setprivacy`. Then the bot
   will only listen when a user's message starts with `/bot`.

For more information, check out the [Telegram HTTP API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).

## Running on Telegram

Add the Telegram credentials to your `credentials.yml`:

```yaml-rasa
telegram:
  access_token: "490161424:AAGlRxinBRtKGb21_rlOEMtDFZMXBl6EC0o"
  verify: "your_bot"
  webhook_url: "https://your_url.com/webhooks/telegram/webhook"
```


Restart your Rasa X or Rasa Open Source server
to make the new channel endpoint available for Telegram to send messages to.
