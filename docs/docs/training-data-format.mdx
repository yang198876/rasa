description: Description of the YAML format for training data
abstract: This page provides an overview of the different types of training data
  that go into a Rasa assistant and how this training data is structured.
---

## Overview

Rasa Open Source uses [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html) as
a unified and extendable way to manage all training data,
including NLU data, stories and rules.

With the YAML format, training data can be split over any number of YAML files,
and every file can contain any kind of data.
The training data parser will read the top level keys in each file to decide
what kind of data is in a section at training time.

The [domain](glossary.mdx#domain) uses
the same YAML format as the training data and can also be split across
multiple files or combined in one file. The domain includes
the definitions for [responses](responses.mdx) and [forms](forms.mdx).
See the [documentation for the domain](domain.mdx) for information on how to format your domain file.

:::note Legacy Formats
Looking for Rasa Open Source 1.x data formats? They are now deprecated, but
you can still find the documentation for <a href="https://legacy-docs-v1.rasa.com/nlu/training-data-format/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">markdown NLU data</a> and <a href="https://legacy-docs-v1.rasa.com/core/stories/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">markdown stories</a>.
:::

### High-Level Structure

Each file can contain one or more **keys** with corresponding training
data. One file can contain multiple keys, as long as there is not more
than one of a certain key in a single file. The available keys are:

- `version`
- `nlu`
- `stories`
- `rules`

All YAML training data files should specify the `version` key to be parsed
correctly. If you don't specify a version key in your training data file, Rasa
will assume you are using the latest training data format specification supported
by the version of Rasa Open Source you have installed.
Training data files with a version greater than is currently available in
the version of Rasa Open Source you have installed will be
skipped.
Currently, the latest training data format specification for Rasa 2.x is 2.0.

### Example

Here's a short example which keeps all training data in a single file:

```yaml-rasa
version: "2.0"

nlu:
- intent: greet
  examples: |
    - Hey
    - Hi
    - hey there [Sara](name)

- intent: faq/language
  examples: |
    - What language do you speak?
    - Do you only handle english?

stories:
- story: greet and faq
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
  - intent: faq
  - action: utter_faq

rules:
- rule: Greet user
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet

```

If you want to specify your test stories, you need to put them into a separate file:
```yaml-rasa title="tests/test_stories.yml"
stories:
- story: greet and ask language
- steps:
  - user: |
      hey
    intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
  - user: |
      what language do you speak
    intent: faq/language
  - action: utter_faq
```
They use the same format as the story training data.

## NLU Training Data

[NLU](glossary.mdx#nlu) training data consists of example user utterances categorized by
[intent](glossary.mdx#intent). Training examples can also include [entities](glossary.mdx#entity). Entities are structured
pieces of information that can be extracted from a user's message. You can also
add extra information such as regular expressions and lookup tables to your
training data to help the model identify intents and entities correctly.

NLU training data is defined under the `nlu` key. Items that can be added under this key are:

- [Training examples](#training-examples) grouped by user intent e.g.
  optionally with annotated [entities](#entities)

```yaml-rasa
nlu:
- intent: check_balance
  examples: |
    - What's my [credit](account) balance?
    - What's the balance on my [credit card account]{"entity":"account","value":"credit"}
```

- [Synonyms](#synonyms)

```yaml-rasa
nlu:
- synonym: credit
  examples: |
    - credit card account
    - credit account
```

- [Regular expressions](#regular-expressions)

```yaml-rasa
nlu:
- regex: account_number
  examples: |
    - \d{10,12}
```

- [Lookup tables](#lookup-tables)

```yaml-rasa
nlu:
- lookup: banks
  examples: |
    - JPMC
    - Comerica
    - Bank of America
```

### Training Examples

Training examples are grouped by [intent](glossary.mdx#intent) and listed under the
`examples` key. Usually, you'll list one example per line as follows:

```yaml-rasa
nlu:
- intent: greet
  examples: |
    - hey
    - hi
    - whats up
```

However, it's also possible to use an extended format if you have a custom NLU component and need metadata for your examples:


```yaml-rasa
nlu:
- intent: greet
  examples:
  - text: |
      hi
    metadata:
      sentiment: neutral
  - text: |
      hey there!
```

The `metadata` key can contain arbitrary key-value data that stays with an example and is accessible by the components in the NLU pipeline. In the example above, the sentiment of
the example could be used by a custom component in the pipeline for sentiment analysis.

You can also specify this metadata at the intent level:

```yaml-rasa
nlu:
- intent: greet
  metadata:
    sentiment: neutral
  examples:
  - text: |
      hi
  - text: |
      hey there!
```

In this case, the content of the `metadata` key is passed on to every intent example.


If you want to specify [retrieval intents](glossary.mdx#retrieval-intent), then your NLU examples will look as follows:
```yaml-rasa
nlu:
- intent: chitchat/ask_name
  examples: |
    - What is your name?
    - May I know your name?
    - What do people call you?
    - Do you have a name for yourself?

- intent: chitchat/ask_weather
  examples: |
    - What's the weather like today?
    - Does it look sunny outside today?
    - Oh, do you mind checking the weather for me please?
    - I like sunny days in Berlin.
```
All retrieval intents have a suffix
added to them which identifies a particular response key for your assistant, in the
above example `ask_name` and `ask_weather` are the suffixes. The suffix is separated from
the retrieval intent name by a `/` delimiter.

:::note Special meaning of `/`
As shown in the above examples, the `/` symbol is reserved as a delimiter to separate
retrieval intents from their associated response keys. Make sure not to use it in the
name of your intents.
:::


### Entities

[Entities](glossary.mdx#entity) are structured pieces of information that can be extracted from a user's message. 

Entities are annotated in training examples with minimally the entity's name.
In addition to the entity name, you can annotate an entity with [synonyms](nlu-training-data.mdx#synonyms), [roles, or groups](nlu-training-data.mdx#entities-roles-and-groups).

In training examples, entity annotation would look like this:

```yaml-rasa
nlu:
- intent: check_balance
  examples: |
    - how much do I have on my [savings]("account") account
    - how much money is in my [checking]{"entity": "account"} account
    - What's the balance on my [credit card account]{"entity":"account","value":"credit"}

```

The full possible syntax for annotating an entity is:

```text
[<entity-text>]{"entity": "<entity name>", "role": "<role name>", "group": "<group name>", "value": "<entity synonym>"}
```

The keywords `role`, `group`, and `value` are optional in this notation.
The `value` keyword refers to synonyms. To understand what the labels `role` and `group` are
for, see the section on [entity roles and groups](./nlu-training-data.mdx#entities-roles-and-groups).


### Synonyms

Synonyms provide a way to normalize your training data by mapping an
extracted entity to a value other than the literal text extracted.
Synonyms can be defined in the format:

```yaml-rasa
nlu:
- synonym: credit
  examples: |
    - credit card account
    - credit account
```

Synonyms can also be defined in-line in your training examples by
specifying the `value` of the entity:

```yaml-rasa
nlu:
- intent: check_balance
  examples: |
    - how much do I have on my [credit card account]{"entity": "account", "value": "credit"}
    - how much do I owe on my [credit account]{"entity": "account", "value": "credit"}
```

Read more about synonyms on the [NLU Training Data page](./nlu-training-data.mdx#synonyms).

### Regular Expressions

You can use regular expressions to improve intent classification and
entity extraction in combination with the [`RegexFeaturizer`](components.mdx#regexfeaturizer) and [`RegexEntityExtractor`](components.mdx#regexentityextractor) components in the pipeline.

The format for defining a regular expression is as follows:

```yaml-rasa
nlu:
- regex: account_number
  examples: |
    - \d{10,12}
```

Here `account_number` is the name of the regular expression. When used as as features for the `RegexFeaturizer` the name of the regular expression does not matter. When using the `RegexEntityExtractor`, the name of the regular expression should match the name of the entity you want to extract.


Read more about when and how to use regular expressions with each component on the [NLU Training Data page](./nlu-training-data.mdx#regular-expressions).



### Lookup Tables

Lookup tables are lists of words used to generate
case-insensitive regular expression patterns. The format is as follows:

```yaml-rasa
nlu:
- lookup: banks
  examples: |
    - JPMC
    - Bank of America
```

When you supply a lookup table in your training data, the contents of that table
are combined into one large regular expression. This regex is used to check
each training example to see if it contains matches for entries in the
lookup table.

Lookup table regexes are processed identically to the regular
expressions directly specified in the training data and can be used
either with the [RegexFeaturizer](components.mdx#regexfeaturizer)
or with the [RegexEntityExtractor](components.mdx#regexentityextractor).
The name of the lookup table is subject to the same constraints as the
name of a regex feature.

Read more about using lookup tables on the [NLU Training Data page](./nlu-training-data.mdx#lookup-tables).

## Conversation Training Data

Stories and rules are both representations of conversations between a user
and a conversational assistant. They are used to train the dialogue management
model. [Stories](stories.mdx) are used to train a machine learning model
to identify patterns in conversations and generalize to unseen conversation paths.
[Rules](rules.mdx) describe small pieces of conversations that should always
follow the same path and are used to train the
[RulePolicy](policies.mdx#rule-policy).


### Stories

Stories are composed of:

  - `story`: The story's name. The name is arbitrary and not used in training;
    you can use it as a human-readable reference for the story.
  - `metadata`: arbitrary and optional, not used in training,
    you can use it to store relevant information about the story
    like e.g. the author
  - a list of `steps`: The user messages and actions that make up the story

For example:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: Greet the user
  metadata:
    author: Somebody
    key: value
  steps:
  # list of steps
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
```

Each step can be one of the following:

  - A [user message](#user-messages), represented by **intent** and **entities**.
  - An [or statement](#or-statement), which includes two or more user messages under it
  - A bot [action](#actions)
  - A [form](#forms)
  - A [slot was set](#slots) event
  - A [checkpoint](#checkpoints), which connects the story to another story


#### User Messages

All user messages are specified with the `intent:`
key and an optional `entities:` key.

While writing stories, you do not have to deal with the specific
contents of the messages that the users send. Instead, you can take
advantage of the output from the NLU pipeline, which lets you use
the combination of an intent and entities to refer to all the possible
messages the users can send to mean the same thing.

User messages follow the format:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: user message structure
  steps:
    - intent: intent_name  # Required
      entities:  # Optional
      - entity_name: entity_value
```

For example, to represent the sentence
`I want to check my credit balance`, where `credit` is an entity:

```yaml-rasa {4-6}
stories:
- story: story with entities
  steps:
  - intent: account_balance
    entities:
    - account_type: credit
  - action: action_credit_account_balance
```

It is important to include the entities here as well because the
policies learn to predict the next action based on a *combination* of
both the intent and entities (you can, however, change this behavior
using the [`use_entities`](#entities) attribute).


#### Actions

All actions executed by the bot are specified with the `action:` key followed
by the name of the action.
While writing stories, you will encounter two types of actions:


1. [Responses](domain.mdx#responses): start with `utter_` and
   send a specific message to the user. e.g.

```yaml-rasa {5}
stories:
- story: story with a response
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
```

2. [Custom actions](custom-actions.mdx): start with `action_`, run
   arbitrary code and send any number of messages (or none).

```yaml-rasa {5}
stories:
- story: story with a custom action
  steps:
  - intent: feedback
  - action: action_store_feedback
```

#### Forms


A [form](glossary.mdx#form) is a specific kind of custom action that contains the logic to loop over
a set of required slots and ask the user for this information. You
[define a form](forms.mdx#defining-a-form) in the `forms` section in your domain.
Once defined, the [happy path](glossary.mdx#happy--unhappy-paths)
for a form should be specified as a [rule](forms.mdx), but interruptions of forms or
other "unhappy paths" should be included in stories so that the model can
generalize to unseen conversation sequences.
As a step in a story, a form takes the following basic format:


```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: story with a form
  steps:
  - intent: find_restaurant
  - action: restaurant_form                # Activate the form
  - active_loop: restaurant_form           # This form is currently active
  - active_loop: null                      # Form complete, no form is active
  - action: utter_restaurant_found
```


The `action` step activates the form and begins looping over the required slots. The `active_loop: restaurant_form`
step indicates that there is a currently active form. Much like a `slot_was_set` step,
a `form` step doesn't **set** a form to active but indicates that it should already be activated.
In the same way, the  `active_loop: null` step indicates that no form should be active before the subsequent
steps are taken.

A form can be interrupted and remain active; in this case the interruption should come after the
`action: <form to activate>` step and be followed by the `active_loop: <active form>` step.
An interruption of a form could look like this:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: interrupted food
  steps:
    - intent: request_restaurant
    - action: restaurant_form
    - intent: chitchat
    - action: utter_chitchat
    - active_loop: restaurant_form
    - active_loop: null
    - action: utter_slots_values
```


#### Slots

A slot event is specified under the key `slot_was_set:` with the
slot name and optionally the slot's value.

**[Slots](domain.mdx#slots)** act as the bots memory.
Slots are **set** by entities or by custom actions and **referenced**
by stories in `slot_was_set` steps. For example:

```yaml-rasa {5-6}
stories:
- story: story with a slot
  steps:
  - intent: celebrate_bot
  - slot_was_set:
    - feedback_value: positive
  - action: utter_yay
```

This means the story requires that the current value for the `feedback_value`
slot be `positive` for the conversation to continue as specified.

Whether or not you need to include the slot's value depends on the
[slot type](domain.mdx#slot-types) and whether the value can or should
influence the dialogue. If the value doesn't matter, list only
the slot's name:

```yaml-rasa {5-6}
stories:
- story: story with a slot
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - slot_was_set:
    - name
  - action: utter_greet_user_by_name
```


:::note How slots work
Stories do not **set** slots. The slot must be set by an entity or custom
action **before** the `slot_was_set` step.
:::


#### Checkpoints

Checkpoints are specified with the `checkpoint:` key, either at the beginning
or the end of a story.


Checkpoints are ways to connect stories together. They can be either the first
or the last step in a story. If they are the last step in a story, that story
will be connected to each other story that starts with the checkpoint of the
same name when the model is trained. Here is an example of a story that ends
with a checkpoint, and one that starts with the same checkpoint:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: story_with_a_checkpoint_1
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
  - checkpoint: greet_checkpoint

- story: story_with_a_checkpoint_2
  steps:
  - checkpoint: greet_checkpoint
  - intent: book_flight
  - action: action_book_flight
```

Checkpoints at the beginning of stories can also be conditional on
slots being set, for example:

```yaml-rasa {6-8}
stories:
- story: story_with_a_conditional_checkpoint
  steps:
  - checkpoint: greet_checkpoint
    # This checkpoint should only apply if slots are set to the specified value
    slot_was_set:
    - context_scenario: holiday
    - holiday_name: thanksgiving
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet_thanksgiving
```


Checkpoints can help simplify your training data and reduce redundancy in it,
but **do not overuse them**. Using lots of checkpoints can quickly make your
stories hard to understand. It makes sense to use them if a sequence of steps
is repeated often in different stories, but stories without checkpoints
are easier to read and write.

#### OR statement

`or` steps are ways to handle multiple intents the same way,
without writing a separate story for each intent. For example, if you ask the user to
confirm something, you might want to treat the `affirm` and `thankyou` intents in the
same way. Stories with `or` steps will be converted into multiple
separate stories at training time. For example, the following story would be converted
to two stories at training time:

```yaml-rasa {6-8}
stories:
- story: story with OR
  steps:
  - intent: signup_newsletter
  - action: utter_ask_confirm
  - or:
    - intent: affirm
    - intent: thanks
  - action: action_signup_newsletter
```

Just like checkpoints, OR statements can be useful, but if you are using a lot of them,
it is probably better to restructure your domain and/or intents.

:::warning Don't overuse
Overusing these features (both checkpoints and OR statements) will slow down training.
:::

### Rules

Rules are listed under the `rules` key and look similar to stories. A rule also has a `steps`
key, which contains a list of the same steps as stories do. Rules can additionally
contain the `conversation_started` and `conditions` keys. These are used to specify conditions
under which the rule should apply.

A rule that with a condition looks like this:

```yaml-rasa
rules:
- rule: Only say `hey` when the user provided a name
  condition:
  - slot_was_set:
    - user_provided_name: true
  steps:
  - intent: greet
  - action: utter_greet
```

For more information about writing rules, see [Rules](rules.mdx#writing-a-rule).

## Test Conversations

Test conversations use stories to test your bot. The tests check if a message is
classified correctly as well as the action predictions.

Test stories use the same format as [stories](#stories),
except that user message steps can include a `user` to specify the actual
text and entity annotations of the user message. Here's an example of a
test conversation:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
- story: A basic end-to-end test
  steps:
  - user: |
     hey
    intent: greet
  - action: utter_ask_howcanhelp
  - user: |
     show me [chinese]{"entity": "cuisine"} restaurants
    intent: inform
  - action: utter_ask_location
  - user: |
     in [Paris]{"entity": "location"}
    intent: inform
  - action: utter_ask_price
```

Running the tests can be done using the CLI:
```bash
rasa test
```
